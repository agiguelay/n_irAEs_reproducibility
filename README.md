# scRNAseq + TCRseq data analysis of n-irAE patients

This repository provides all scripts to reproduce the analysis in our manuscript. 
The script requires CellRanger outputs for each sample, which will be made available on GEO. Those files can also be reproduced from fastq files available on EGA.

In this study, we performed multimodal analysis (5'scRNAseq and TCR-seq) on PBMCs from cancer patients developing or not neurological adverse events (n-irAEs) following immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) treatment.

This study has been completed by the [Ludwig Lab](https://www.bihealth.org/en/research/research-group/stem-cell-dynamics-mitochondrial-genomics).
